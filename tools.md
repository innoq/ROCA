Libraries and Frameworks

### Introduction

While ROCA is independent of any particular framework or library, this
page aims to provide a starting point by listing both client-side
(i.e. JavaScript) and server-side libraries and frameworks that can be
used if you happen to have made up your mind to follow ROCA
recommendations, or want to assess the quality of tool support. Please
help us expand this list!
