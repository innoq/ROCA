title: "ROCA: Resource-oriented Client Architecture"
---
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A Web application's architecture is heavily influenced by the
	design decisions, both implicit and explicit, that have been
	made by framework developers. Sometimes these decisions are
	consciously accepted as being in line with the intended overall
	system architecture. More often, though, they are accepted
	simply because developers assume they embody the state of the
	art of development practices.
</p>
<p>ROCA is an attempt to define a set of recommendations &mdash;
	independent of any particular framework, programming language,
	or tooling &mdash; that embodies the principles of what we consider to
	be good web application architecture. Its purpose is to serve as
	a reference, one that can be implemented as-is or be compared to
	other approaches to highlight diverging design
	decisions.
</p>
<p>ROCA splits into two parts: The <a href="#server-side">server-side</a> 
    and the <a href="#client-side">client-side</a> architecture. 
    The server-side consists of 
    RESTful backends, serving human-readable content as well as
    services for machine-to-machine communication, either public or internal.
    The client-side focuses on a sustainable and maintainable usage of
    JavaScript and CSS, based on the principle of Progressive 
    Enhancement. This technique is pursued by nearly every basic
    web technology, e.g. HTML or HTTP.
    Client and server are largely independent 
    from, yet complement each other.

<h2 id="server-side">Server-side</h2>
<ol>
	<li id="rest">The server application adheres to
		REST principles, i.e. it exposes a set of
		resources that are meaningful to a user sitting in
		front of a browser, each resource has its own URI, all
		of the information necessary for handling a request is
		contained within the request itself, HTTP methods are used
		in line with their definition, and the resource state
		is maintained by the server (stateless
		communication). [<a href="#rest">rest</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="application-logic">All application logic resides
		on the server. [<a href="#application-logic">application-logic</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="http">The client interacts with the server through
	    RESTful HTTP requests. [<a href="#http">http</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="link">A user must be able to link to a specific
		piece of information, e.g. by copying the address from the
		browser's address bar and pasting it into an e-mail,
		creating a bookmark, or using any of the fancier ways to
		share URIs. [<a href="#link">link</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="non-browser">It must be possible to use
		the server's logic through user agents other than a browser,
		e.g. a command-line client such as curl or
		wget. [<a href="#non-browser">non-browser</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="should-formats">Resources have additional representations in other formats, e.g.
		JSON and/or XML. [<a href="#should-formats">should-formats</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="auth">All authenticated communication relies
		on HTTP Basic Authentication over SSL (or Client
		Certificates). Alternatively, because of browser limits in
		handling basic auth (e.g. no logout, no styling), form-based
		authentication in conjunction with cookies can be used. If cookies
		are used, they should include all of the state needed for the
		server to process them, and another authentication mechanism
		should be supported for non-browser
		access. [<a href="#auth">auth</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="cookies">Cookies may not be used for purposes other than
		authentication or user tracking. [<a href="#cookies">cookies</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="session">There may not be any session state beyond
		what&#8217;s needed for simple algorithmic validation of
		authentication information. [<a href="#session">session</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="browser-controls">The browser controls like the back, forward
	    and refresh buttons must work as expected. 
	    I.e. the back button should take the users where they
		expect to be taken to (the last meaningful resource they
		worked with).
		A browser refresh should not cause a re-rendering of the login or
		home page instead of the page the user was looking at, or a
		(to the user) unexpected question about wanting to
		submit the same data again (when the user doesn't recall
		submitting any data, indicating a mis-use of the POST verb).
		[<a href="#browser-controls">browser-controls</a>]
	</li>	
</ol>

<h2 id="client-side">Client-side</h2>
<ol>
	<li id="posh">The server returns structured semantic HTML markup that is
		independent of layout information and client behavior. 
		[<a href="#posh">posh</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="accessibility">It must be possible to access each page's information 
	    and functionality by using accessibility tools like screen readers.
	    [<a href="#accessibility">accessibility</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="layout">
	    CSS is used for formatting and layouting. This is done following the 
	    principles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement" 
		title="Progressive enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>, e.g. to allow
		a browser not capable of CSS3 features still to use a CSS3-based site.
	</li>
	<li id="unobtrusive-javascript">In line with the principles
		of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement" 
		title="Progressive enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>, JavaScript is
		used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript"
		title="Unobtrusive JavaScript">unobtrusively</a>
		and the application remains usable (albeit with a
		decrease in usability and convenience) if JavaScript is
		disabled. [<a href="#unobtrusive-javascript">unobtrusive-javascript</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="no-duplication">The same functionality must not be implemented 
		redundantly on both the client (JavaScript) and the server. 
		Thus, due to the <a href="#application-logic">application logic 
		requirement</a>, application logic must not reside on the client-side.
		 [<a href="#no-duplication" class="anchor">no-duplication</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="know-structure"> The server code may not "know" the
		HTML structures the client code generates (beyond CSS) or 
		vice versa. Exceptions are some well defined HTML structures the server 
		generates to initialize the client functionality above.
		[<a href="#know-structure" class="anchor">know-structure</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="static-assets">All JavaScript code and CSS code must be static,
		and must not be dynamically generated by the server in
		a form specific to the resource requested. 
		(Note that this does not prohibit the use of preprocessors 
		like <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" title="CoffeeScript">CoffeeScript</a> or 
		<a href="http://www.lesscss.de/" title="LSS CSS">LESS</a>, 
		as the respective code is usually pre-compiled as part of the release 
		process.) [<a href="#static-assets" class="anchor">static-assets</a>]
	</li>
	<li id="historyapi">Any dynamic routing or URI state
		modification triggered by JavaScript on the client
		side should use the HTML5 History API. 
		[<a href="#historyapi">historyapi</a>]
	</li>
