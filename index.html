	<h1>ROCA: Resource-oriented Client Architecture</h1>
	<p><em>A collection of simple best practices for decent Web applications</em></p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Web application architecture is heavily influenced by the
		design decisions, both implicit and explicit, that have been
		made by framework developers. Sometimes these decisions are
		consciously accepted as being in line with the intended overall
		system architecture. More often, though, they are accepted
		simply because developers assume they embody the state of the
		art of development practices. However, we find that very often
		frameworks are driven more by their authors&#8217; personal
		taste, the intent to create something new, a desire to hide the
		Web and turn it into something different, or any combination of
		these factors.
	</p>
	<p>ROCA is an attempt to define a set of recommendations -
		independent of any particular framework, programming language,
		or tooling - that embodies the principles of what we consider to
		be good web application architecture. Its purpose is to serve as
		a reference, one that can be implemented as is or be compared to
		other approaches to highlight diverging design decisions.

			<h2>MUSTs</h2>
			<p>A web application's architecture is compliant to the ROCA
				style if it meets all of the following mandatory requirements:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The server application adheres to REST principles,
					i.e. the server exposes a set of resources with their own URIs
					that are meaningful to a user sitting in front of a browser, all
					of the information necessary for handling a request is contained
					in the request itself and the resource state maintained by the
					server (stateless communication). The core application
					logic is contained on the server, and invoked by
					interacting with it through RESTful HTTP requests.
				</li>
				<li>The server returns structured HTML markup that is
					independent of layout information; CSS is used for
					formatting.
				</li>
				<li>In line with the principles
					of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement" 
					title="Progressive enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>, JavaScript is
					used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript" 
					title="Unobtrusive JavaScript">unobtrusively</a>
					and the application is still usable (albeit with a
					decrease in usability and convenience) if JavaScript is
					disabled.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class='span4'>
			<h2>SHOULDs</h2>
			<p>The following concepts are encouraged, but not mandatory:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Resources have additional representations in other formats, e.g.
					JSON and/or XML
				</li>
				<li>All authenticated communication relies on HTTP Basic
					Authentication over SSL (or Client
					Certificates). Alternatively, cookies can be used if
					they include all of the state needed for the server to
					process them
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class='span4'>
			<h2>MUST NOTs</h2>
			<p>The following characteristics are clear indications that the ROCA style is violated:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Cookies are used for purposes other than authentication
				</li>
				<li>There is session state beyond what&#8217;s needed for
					simple algorithmic validation of authentication
					information
				</li>
				<li>Back button, bookmarking, linking to specific
					information doesn&#8217;t work as expected by the
					user
				</li>
				<li>A browser refresh causes unexpected behavior (e.g. a
					re-rendering of the login or home page)
				</li>
				<li>The content sent to the client mainly consists of
					JavaScript that retrieves the real content from the
					server
				</li>
			</ol>
