title: "ROCA: Resource-oriented Client Architecture"
---
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A Web application's architecture is heavily influenced by the
	design decisions, both implicit and explicit, that have been
	made by framework developers. Sometimes these decisions are
	consciously accepted as being in line with the intended overall
	system architecture. More often, though, they are accepted
	simply because developers assume they embody the state of the
	art of development practices. However, we find that very often
	frameworks are driven more by their authors&#8217; personal
	taste, the intent to create something new, a desire to hide the
	Web and turn it into something different, or any combination of
	these factors.
</p>
<p>ROCA is an attempt to define a set of recommendations &mdash;
	independent of any particular framework, programming language,
	or tooling &mdash; that embodies the principles of what we consider to
	be good web application architecture. Its purpose is to serve as
	a reference, one that can be implemented as-is or be compared to
	other approaches to highlight diverging design
	decisions.
</p>

<h2>Mandatory Requirements</h2>
<p>A web application's architecture is compliant to the ROCA
	style if it meets all of the following mandatory requirements:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><a name='must-rest'></a>The server application adheres to
		REST principles, i.e. the server exposes a set of
		resources that are meaningful to a user sitting in
		front of a browser, each resource has its own URI, all
		of the information necessary for handling a request is
		contained in the request itself, HTTP methods are used
		in line with their definition, and the resource state
		is maintained by the server (stateless
		communication). [<a href='#must-rest'>must-rest</a>]
	</li>
	<li><a name='must-server'></a>All application logic resides
	  on the server; the client interacts with the server through
	  RESTful HTTP requests. For performance or user experience
	  reasons, some code may exist on both client and server
	  (e.g. for field validations). [<a href='#must-server'>must-server</a>]
	</li>
	<li><a name='must-non-browser'></a>It must be possible to use
	  the server's logic through user agents other than a browser,
	  e.g. a command line client such as curl or
	  wget. [<a href='#must-non-browser'>must-non-browser</a>]
	</li>
	<li><a name='must-html'></a>The server returns structured HTML markup that is
		independent of layout information; CSS is used for
		formatting. [<a href='#must-html'>must-html</a>]
	</li>
	<li><a name='must-jslimits'></a>In line with the principles
		of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement" 
		title="Progressive enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>, JavaScript is
		used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript" 
		title="Unobtrusive JavaScript">unobtrusively</a>
		and the application remains usable (albeit with a
		decrease in usability and convenience) if JavaScript is
		disabled. [<a href='#must-jslimits'>must-jslimits</a>]
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Suggested Practices</h2>
<p>The following concepts are encouraged, but not mandatory:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a name='should-formats'></a>Resources have additional representations in other formats, e.g.
    JSON and/or XML. [<a href='#should-formats'>should-formats</a>]
  </li>
  <li><a name='should-auth'></a>All authenticated communication relies
    on HTTP Basic Authentication over SSL (or Client
    Certificates). Alternatively, because of browser limits in
    handling basic auth (e.g. no logout, no styling), form-based
    authentication in conjunction with cookies can be used. If cookies
    are used, they should include all of the state needed for the
    server to process them, and another authentication mechanism
    should be supported for non-browser
    access. [<a href='#should-auth'>should-auth</a>]
  </li>
  <li>
    <a name='should-historyapi'></a>Any dynamic routing or URI state modification triggered
    by JavaScript on the client side should use the HTML5 History API. [<a href='#should-historyapi'>should-historyapi</a>] 
  </li>
</ol>


<h2>Violations</h2>
<p>The following characteristics are clear indications that the ROCA style is violated:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a name='mustnot-cookies'></a>Cookies
	are used for purposes other than
	authentication or user tracking. [<a href='#mustnot-cookies'>mustnot-cookies</a>]
	</li>
	<li><a name='mustnot-session'></a>There
		is session state beyond
		what&#8217;s needed for simple
		algorithmic validation of
		authentication
		information. [<a href='#mustnot-session'>mustnot-session</a>]
	</li>
	<li><a name='mustnot-break-back'></a>The back and forward buttons don't
		work as expected, i.e. they
		don't take the user where they
		expect to be taken to (the
		last meaningful resource they
		worked with). [<a href='#mustnot-break-back'>mustnot-break-back</a>]
	</li>
	<li><a name='mustnot-break-link'></a>A user can't link to a specific
		piece of information, e.g. by
		copying the address from the
		browser's address bar and
		pasting it into an email, by
		creating a bookmark, or using
		any of the fancier ways to
		share URIs. [<a href='#mustnot-break-link'>mustnot-break-link</a>]
	</li>
	<li><a name='mustnot-break-refresh'></a>A browser refresh causes
		unexpected behavior, e.g. a
		re-rendering of the login or
		home page instead of the page
		the user is looking at, or a
		(to the user) unexpected
		question about wanting to
		submit the same data again
		(when the user doesn't recall
		submitting any data,
		indicating a mis-use of the
		POST verb). [<a href='#mustnot-break-refresh'>mustnot-break-refresh</a>]
	</li>
	<li><a name='mustnot-jsengine'></a>The content sent to the client mainly consists of
		JavaScript that then retrieves the real content from the
		server, requiring JavaScript
		to be enabled to make any
		sense of the application. [<a href='#mustnot-jsengine'>mustnot-jsengine</a>]
	</li>
	<li><a name='shouldnot-jsrouting'></a>Routing is done wholly on the client side: JavaScript is used to generate
	  and maintain URIs used all over the application, at worst involving hacks like hash-bang URI components.
	  [<a href='#mustnot-jsrouting'>mustnot-jsrouting</a>]
  </li>
	<li><a name='mustnot-break-accessibility'></a>Tools for accessibility,
		e.g. screen readers, can't be used. [<a href='#mustnot-break-accessibility'>mustnot-break-accessibility</a>] 
	</li>
</ol>
