Q&A
---

### Why ROCA?
In our work, we found that it's far easier to get ideas
across if they can be referred to by name, compared against
other approaches, and thus be made tangible. ROCA is an attempt
to provide a reference for exactly this purpose.

### Why "ROCA"?
It was the most reasonable and easy-to-remember name we could
come up with that also resolved to a meaningful acronym.

### How can I install the framework?

You don't &#8211; that's the point. ROCA is
intended to be framework-agnostic. You can pick any programming
language, library, or framework, as long as you adhere to the
aspects described above.

If you really need a framework, we recommend you
try [here](http://www.dafk.net/what/).

### What are good frameworks that are a good choice for the ROCA style?
We plan to include a section on this, but would like to test
the community's reaction first.

### But what about single-page apps? Aren't they the future?
We don't think so; in our view, single page apps repeat the
mistakes of unnecessarily fat server-side Web frameworks on
the client side. The fact that the Web relies on a series of
resource representations that are linked to each other is not
a bug, it's a feature.
  
### Who's behind ROCA?
The ROCA style itself is nothing new and can be seen in the
wild in any number of Web applications. The name and this
document have been created by Till Schulte-Coerne, Stefan
Tilkov, Phillip Ghadir and Josh Graham.
